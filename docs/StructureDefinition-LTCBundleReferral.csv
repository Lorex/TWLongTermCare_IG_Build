* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates

This outcome is not used for error responses in batch/transaction, only for hints and warnings. In a batch operation, the error will be in Bundle.entry.response, and for transaction, there will be a single OperationOutcome instead of a bundle in the case of an error.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Bundle.entry.response.outcome",0,1,"",""

Requirements around inclusion of a signature, verification of signatures and treatment of signed/non-signed bundles is implementation-environment specific.","A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form. The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWS), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process. This element allows capturing signatures on documents, messages, transactions or even search responses, to support content-authentication, non-repudiation or other business cases. This is primarily relevant where the bundle may travel through multiple hops or via other mechanisms where HTTPS non-repudiation is insufficient.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Bundle.signature",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
